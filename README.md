# Big Data with Spark Project
In this milestone, we continued to preprocess the data to prepare to fit our data to a linear regression model. Looking deeper at our data, we quickly realized that some locations in our dataset had incorrect longitude and latitude, so we removed those locations from our data. We further pre-processed our data by converting our pollutant values to standardized consisitent units as our data consistented of inconsistent units across readings of the same pollutant. We calculated daily averages of our values for all parameters, and then pivoted the data to split up the parameters into their own columns. Now, we wanted to filter our data to only obtain locations that are within the US region only. We attempted to use an geocoder, but this method proved unpractical as we hit Geopy rate limits. We resorted to utilizing the longitude and latitude features of each location to filter for locations that were within the longitude and latitude boundaries of the US region. 

AQI (Air Quality Index) is a standardized score metric that is used to categorize the quality of air. We utilized a python AQI library that can convert between pollutant values and an AQI score, which can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/python-aqi/. Using the AQI library we were able to calculate a AQI score for each time point of data, and using standardized thresholds for AQI scores categorize each time point into categories of "good", "moderate", "unhealthy", etc. These thresholds for AQI can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/air-data-basic-information. 

We fit a linear regression model to our data to see if we could correctly predict future values. For our linear regression model, we utilized the readings of the pm 2.5 pollutant. The pm2.5 pollutant includes fine particules, which can directly lead to many health issues such as heart disease, lung cancer, and stroke (https://undark.org/breathtaking/). We calcualted the daily average pm 2.5 values across all locations in the US for the data present in our dataset. Using pre-2023 data as our training set, we trained our linear regression model and tested it on post 2023 data and evaluated our test and training set error.
